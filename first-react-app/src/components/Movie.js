            <p>Description: Breakin 2: Electric Boogaloo is a 1984 film directed by Sam
              Firstenberg. It is a sequel to the 1984 breakdancing film
              Breakin. Electric Boogaloo was released nine months after its
              predecessor by TriStar Pictures and by Cannon Films a few months
              later. In some international locations the film was released under
              the title Breakdance 2: Electric Boogaloo. Another sequel, Rappin
              (also known as Breakdance 3) was made but had an unconnected plot
              and different lead characters – only Ice-T features in all three
              movies.</p>
