Historically, JavaScript was used primarily for client-side scripting, in which scripts written in JavaScript are embedded in a webpages HTML, to be run client-side by a JavaScript engine in the users web browser. Node.js enables JavaScript to be used for server-side scripting, and runs scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user\'s web browser. ',
